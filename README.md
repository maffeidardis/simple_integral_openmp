# Simple Integral by Numerical Integration
This was the final project of the UFSCar parallel programming discipline, offered in the supplementary semester.

The objective was to apply a parallelization strategy, in this case, OpenMP, to some project. 

I chose to develop an algorithm that calculated a simple integral using the Trapezoid Method and had its efficiency increased by the mentioned parallelization strategy.

In this discipline I had my first contact with C++ and this was my first mini project in this programming language.
